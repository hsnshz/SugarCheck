A cross platform mobile app that uses Machine Learning algorithms to predict diabetes and offers diabetes management tools 
such as diabetes prediction, meal logging, recipe search, glucose monitoring, AI-driven HbA1c estimation, Exercise Tracking, Report generation and more.

The app is built using a variety of tools such as React Native for the front-end, Express.js (Node.js) for the backend, MongoDB for the database and Python for the machine learning algorithms.

This app is for my final year project.
